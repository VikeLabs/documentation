# Initialize Project Docs

These steps will get your project documentation started.

1. Duplicate this directory (`/docs/template`) and name it `your-project-name`, using **kebab-case**.
2. In `/sidebars.js`, add a key-value pair to the `sidebars` object. Use **camelCase** for the key and ensure the `dirName` is the same as the directory you named in step 1. `yourProjectName: [{type: 'autogenerated', dirName: 'your-project-name'}]`
3. In `/docusaurus.config.js` > `themeConfig.navbar.items` array, add an object similar to the ones in the array already, change the sidebarId to your key in step 2, and change the label.
